## Destription

The "do" directory consists of ModelSim/Questa-related ".do" and ".tcl" scripts responsible for compiling libraries, automizing code compilation and executing HDL simulations from vsim console.

The file named "modules.tcl" is automatically generated by the environment. This file contains compile order of files that were added to the project while running "make src".


## How to Use

General workflow with the use of a board file generator with make:

0. Make sure you are in the project root directory and entered your desired FPGA Part number in "./vivado.mk":
Example: PART = xc7k160tffg676-1

1. Reset the project by typing the following to the command line:
Example 1: make reset
Example 2: make reset PART=genesys2

2. Add all HDL files under the top HDL module to the Vivado project by typing the following to the command line:
Example: make src TOP=reset.vhd

2. 1. Open Vivado in mode GUI to verify these modules were added to Vivado successfully:
Example: make gui

3. 

3. 1. 


## TODO

Adapt to Questa from ModelSim since free version of Modelsim is not available anymore.
